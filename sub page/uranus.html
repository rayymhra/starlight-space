  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in the Solar System. It is an ice giant, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and icy materials like water, methane, and ammonia. Unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side, making its seasons extreme. It has a faint ring system and dozens of moons, most of which are named after characters from Shakespearean plays.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 km, making it the third-largest planet after Jupiter and Saturn. It has a pale blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Uranus is classified as an ice giant because it contains more icy materials than gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. It has at least 27 known moons and a system of faint, dark rings composed of dust and small ice particles.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Uranus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 2.9 billion km (1.8 billion miles) and takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its rotation is unique because it is tilted at an extreme angle of 98 degrees, meaning it essentially rolls around the Sun on its side. This unusual tilt causes one hemisphere to face the Sun for long periods, resulting in extreme seasonal variations.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Uranus does not have a solid surface; instead, it has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Uranus its distinct blue-green color. Beneath the atmosphere, there is a mantle of icy materials, and at its core, there is a small rocky center. The planet's atmosphere contains powerful winds that reach speeds of over 900 km/h (560 mph), and it occasionally experiences massive storms.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures dropping as low as -224°C (-371°F). Despite being farther from the Sun, Neptune is actually warmer because Uranus does not generate much internal heat. The extreme cold and lack of heat sources contribute to the planet’s relatively featureless atmosphere compared to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Uranus has only been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew past the planet in 1986. Voyager 2 provided the first close-up images of Uranus, revealing its faint rings, moons, and tilted rotation. Since then, astronomers have continued studying Uranus using telescopes like Hubble, but no further missions have been sent. Future space missions may explore Uranus more closely to uncover its mysterious interior and atmosphere.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Uranus is named after the ancient Greek god of the sky, Ouranos, who was the father of the Titans. Unlike other planets named after Roman gods, Uranus retains its Greek name. The planet was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, making it the first planet found using a telescope. Its moons are uniquely named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>",
