  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, making it the most distant known planet in the Solar System. It is an ice giant, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and icy materials like water, ammonia, and methane. Neptune is known for its deep blue color, strong winds, and dynamic storms, including the famous Great Dark Spot. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 km, making it the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System. It is very similar in composition to Uranus but has a more active and dynamic atmosphere. Its deep blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Neptune has 14 confirmed moons and a system of faint, dusty rings. Its largest moon, Triton, is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation, suggesting it was captured from the Kuiper Belt.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 4.5 billion km (2.8 billion miles) and takes approximately 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. This means that since its discovery in 1846, Neptune has only completed one full orbit in 2011. The planet rotates on its axis every 16 hours, giving it a shorter day than Earth. Like Uranus, Neptune's axis is tilted, but not as extremely, leading to seasonal variations.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Neptune does not have a solid surface but has a thick atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Beneath the atmosphere, the planet has a mantle of icy materials and a small rocky core. Neptune's atmosphere is the most active of all the giant planets, with powerful winds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph), the fastest in the Solar System. It also experiences large storms, such as the Great Dark Spot, which was observed by Voyager 2 in 1989.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Neptune is one of the coldest planets in the Solar System, with temperatures dropping to about -214°C (-353°F). Despite being farther from the Sun than Uranus, Neptune emits more internal heat, which drives its extreme weather and storm activity. Its deep, icy atmosphere plays a significant role in regulating its climate.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew past the planet in 1989. This mission provided the first detailed images of Neptune, revealing its dynamic atmosphere, rings, and moons. Since then, astronomers have continued studying Neptune using telescopes like Hubble, but no further missions have been sent. Future explorations may focus on studying Neptune’s atmosphere, weather patterns, and its intriguing moon, Triton.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea, known for his power and dominion over the oceans. The planet's deep blue color, resembling the ocean, makes this name fitting. Neptune was discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation, making it the only planet to be discovered this way. Many of its moons are named after sea deities from Greek mythology.</p>",
