  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a diverse environment with oceans, continents, and an atmosphere that sustains a wide variety of organisms. Earth’s unique conditions, including liquid water, a stable climate, and a protective magnetic field, make it habitable. It is the largest of the terrestrial planets and has a dynamic surface shaped by geological processes such as plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanic activity.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 km, making it the largest of the four terrestrial planets. It consists of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a mantle, and a crust. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans. The planet has a protective atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), which is essential for life. Earth also has a strong magnetic field that shields it from harmful solar radiation.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million miles), completing one full orbit in 365.25 days, which defines a year. To account for the extra 0.25 days, a leap year occurs every four years. Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating the day-night cycle. Its axial tilt of approximately 23.5° causes seasonal changes as different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Earth's surface is highly diverse, with vast oceans, mountain ranges, deserts, forests, and ice-covered regions. The movement of tectonic plates shapes the landscape through earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of new landforms. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and weather patterns. It contains greenhouse gases that trap heat, maintaining a stable temperature range necessary for life.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Earth has a relatively moderate and stable climate, with an average surface temperature of about 15°C (59°F). However, temperatures can vary greatly depending on location and season, ranging from -89.2°C (-128.6°F) in Antarctica to 56.7°C (134°F) in Death Valley, California. The presence of an atmosphere and oceans helps distribute heat around the planet, preventing extreme temperature differences between day and night.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Unlike other planets, Earth has been explored extensively by humans. Early exploration included mapping continents and oceans, while modern scientific advancements have led to satellite imaging and deep-sea exploration. Space missions such as the Apollo program provided new perspectives of Earth from space. Observational satellites like the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station (ISS) continue to study Earth's atmosphere, climate, and natural phenomena.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Earth’s name differs from other planets in the Solar System as it does not originate from Roman or Greek mythology. Instead, the name comes from Old English and Germanic words meaning 'ground' or 'soil.' Various cultures throughout history have personified Earth as a deity, such as Gaia in Greek mythology and Terra in Roman mythology. Many ancient civilizations worshipped Earth as a life-giving force, recognizing its importance for agriculture and survival.</p>",
