  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a massive atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for centuries, Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and dozens of moons. Its immense size and composition make it an important object of study for astronomers.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Jupiter has a diameter of about 139,820 km, making it over 11 times wider than Earth. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. The planet has powerful storms, high-speed winds, and an extremely strong magnetic field. Jupiter has at least 95 known moons, including four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, even bigger than Mercury.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Jupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 778 million km (484 million miles) and takes approximately 12 Earth years to complete one orbit. However, it has the fastest rotation of any planet in the Solar System, completing one full rotation in just about 10 hours. This rapid rotation causes Jupiter to bulge at the equator and flatten slightly at the poles.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Jupiter does not have a solid surface like Earth; instead, it is composed of thick layers of gas and liquid. Its atmosphere is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with clouds of ammonia and water forming its colorful bands. The planet’s most famous feature is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm larger than Earth that has been observed for at least 300 years. Jupiter’s powerful storms and jet streams create a constantly changing and turbulent atmosphere.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Jupiter has an average temperature of around -145°C (-234°F) in its upper atmosphere. However, its core is believed to be extremely hot, possibly reaching temperatures of about 24,000°C (43,000°F) due to intense pressure. Unlike rocky planets, Jupiter does not experience large temperature variations between day and night because of its thick atmosphere and strong internal heat source.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, providing valuable data about its composition and moons. The Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s gave the first close-up views of the planet. Later, NASA’s Galileo spacecraft orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, studying its atmosphere and moons in detail. The Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011, is currently studying Jupiter’s magnetic field, atmosphere, and deep interior to uncover more about the planet’s formation and evolution.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods, equivalent to Zeus in Greek mythology. As the most massive planet, it was fittingly named after the most powerful deity. Many of Jupiter’s moons are also named after figures from mythology, particularly those associated with Zeus/Jupiter. Ancient civilizations observed Jupiter as a bright object in the night sky, and it has played an important role in astrology and mythological stories throughout history.</p>",
