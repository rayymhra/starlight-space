  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant known for its stunning ring system, which is made of ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. It has a strong magnetic field, numerous moons, and extreme atmospheric conditions.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Saturn has a diameter of about 116,460 km, making it the second-largest planet after Jupiter. Despite its size, it has the lowest density of all planets, meaning it could theoretically float in water. Saturn's iconic rings are made of countless ice and rock fragments, ranging in size from tiny grains to massive chunks. The planet has at least 146 known moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, which has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Saturn orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 1.4 billion km (886 million miles) and takes approximately 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit. It rotates rapidly, completing one full rotation in about 10.7 hours. This fast rotation causes Saturn to bulge at the equator and flatten slightly at the poles.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Saturn does not have a solid surface but consists of dense layers of gas and liquid. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane and ammonia. Saturn’s atmosphere features powerful storms and jet streams, including a persistent hexagonal-shaped storm at its north pole. The planet’s rings, made mostly of ice, extend up to 282,000 km (175,000 miles) from the planet but are only about 10 meters (30 feet) thick.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Saturn is an extremely cold planet, with an average temperature of about -178°C (-288°F). Unlike rocky planets, Saturn's temperature remains relatively stable due to its thick atmosphere. However, deep inside the planet, high pressure generates heat, and its core is believed to reach thousands of degrees Celsius.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Saturn has been explored by multiple spacecraft, providing incredible insights into its rings, atmosphere, and moons. The Pioneer and Voyager missions provided the first detailed images of Saturn in the late 20th century. In 2004, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft became the first to orbit Saturn, studying its atmosphere, rings, and moons for over 13 years. The Huygens probe, carried by Cassini, landed on Titan in 2005, revealing a landscape with rivers and lakes of liquid methane.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time, equivalent to the Greek god Cronus. In mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter (Zeus in Greek mythology) and was associated with wealth, time, and cycles. Many of Saturn’s moons are named after Titans from Greek mythology. The planet has been observed since ancient times and has long been a subject of fascination due to its bright rings.</p>",
