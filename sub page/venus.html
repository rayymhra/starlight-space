  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's 'sister planet' due to its similar size and composition. However, Venus has a harsh, inhospitable environment with a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System. It has a rocky surface covered with mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains. Venus is known for its slow rotation and extreme greenhouse effect, which keeps its surface temperature high enough to melt lead.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Venus has a diameter of about 12,104 km, making it only slightly smaller than Earth. It is a rocky planet with a dense core, a mantle, and a solid crust. Unlike Earth, Venus has no moons or rings. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System. Venus also has surface features such as large highland regions, volcanic plains, and thousands of volcanoes.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million km (67 million miles) and takes 225 Earth days to complete one orbit. Unlike most planets, Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction of its orbit (retrograde rotation). One day on Venus (one full rotation) takes about 243 Earth days, making it longer than its year. Because of this, the Sun appears to rise in the west and set in the east on Venus.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Venus has a rocky and volcanic landscape, with vast plains, highland regions, and thousands of volcanoes, some of which may still be active. The surface is covered in lava flows, and there are large impact craters scattered across the planet. The atmosphere is incredibly dense and is made mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This thick atmosphere creates a crushing pressure at the surface, about 92 times greater than Earth's. The heavy cloud cover reflects sunlight, making Venus the brightest planet in the night sky.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System, with an average surface temperature of about 467°C (872°F). This extreme heat is due to its thick atmosphere, which traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect. Unlike Mercury, which has extreme temperature fluctuations, Venus has a relatively constant temperature across the entire planet, including at the poles and even on the night side.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Venus has been explored by numerous spacecraft, starting with the Soviet Union's Venera program, which sent probes to land on its surface. The first successful landing was Venera 7 in 1970, which transmitted data for a short time before being destroyed by the extreme heat and pressure. NASA's Magellan spacecraft mapped Venus's surface using radar in the early 1990s. More recently, missions like ESA’s Venus Express and NASA’s Parker Solar Probe have studied the planet’s atmosphere. Upcoming missions, including NASA’s DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, aim to explore Venus in greater detail.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, known as Aphrodite in Greek mythology. The planet's bright appearance in the sky has made it significant in various cultures throughout history. Ancient civilizations often associated Venus with deities of love and fertility. In some cultures, Venus was seen as two different celestial bodies: the 'Morning Star' and the 'Evening Star,' depending on when it was visible.</p>",
