  summary:
    "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Mars has the most Earth-like conditions among the planets, with evidence suggesting it once had liquid water. Scientists have long studied Mars as a potential destination for human exploration, and multiple missions have been sent to analyze its surface, atmosphere, and potential for life.</p>",

  characteristics:
    "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Mars has a diameter of about 6,779 km, making it about half the size of Earth. It has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of nitrogen and argon. Mars has surface features similar to both Earth and the Moon, including mountains, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps. The planet has the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the longest canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>",

  orbit:
    "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 227 million km (141 million miles) and takes approximately 687 Earth days to complete one full orbit. A day on Mars, known as a 'sol,' is about 24.6 hours long, making its rotation period similar to Earth's. Mars has an axial tilt of about 25.2°, which causes seasonal changes, similar to Earth, though its seasons are nearly twice as long due to its longer orbit.</p>",

  surface:
    "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>The surface of Mars is dry, rocky, and covered in fine dust rich in iron oxide, giving it its characteristic red color. It has ancient river valleys, lake beds, and mineral deposits that suggest it once had liquid water. Mars has large dust storms that can engulf the entire planet for weeks. Due to its thin atmosphere, which lacks a strong greenhouse effect, the planet experiences extreme temperature fluctuations and is vulnerable to radiation from space.</p>",

  temperature:
    "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Mars has a cold climate, with an average surface temperature of about -63°C (-81°F). Temperatures can vary widely, ranging from about -140°C (-220°F) at the poles to 20°C (68°F) in warmer regions during summer. The thin atmosphere cannot retain heat efficiently, causing dramatic temperature shifts between day and night.</p>",

  exploration:
    "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Mars is one of the most explored planets in the Solar System. Early observations with telescopes led to speculation about life on Mars. Spacecraft such as Mariner 4, Viking 1 and 2, and more recent rovers like Curiosity, Perseverance, and Opportunity have provided valuable data about the planet’s geology, climate, and potential for past life. The Mars rovers have confirmed the presence of water ice and organic molecules. NASA, SpaceX, and other space agencies are planning future human missions to Mars.</p>",

  mythology:
    "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, reflecting its blood-red appearance. In Greek mythology, Mars was known as Ares, the god of war. Many ancient civilizations associated Mars with war and conflict due to its distinct color. The planet has been an important figure in human culture, often appearing in science fiction as a setting for alien life or human colonization.</p>",
