                Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the
                Solar System. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it is not the
                hottest planet. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, extreme
                temperature fluctuations, and a heavily cratered surface similar
                to the Moon.

          summary:
            "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It has a barren, rocky surface covered in craters, much like Earth's Moon. Mercury lacks a significant atmosphere, causing extreme temperature variations between day and night. Despite its small size, it has a dense metallic core, making it the second-most dense planet after Earth. Mercury has been a subject of interest for astronomers for centuries, and space missions have provided valuable insights into its composition, surface features, and magnetic field.</p>",

          characteristics:
            "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Mercury has a diameter of about 4,880 km, making it the smallest planet in the Solar System and only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It has a dense iron core, which accounts for a significant portion of its mass. The planet’s surface is covered in impact craters due to its lack of an atmosphere to burn up meteors. Mercury has no moons or rings, and it has a very thin exosphere composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, which is constantly being stripped away by solar winds.</p>",

          orbit:
            "<h2>Orbit & Rotation</h2><p>Mercury has a highly elliptical orbit, taking only 88 Earth days to complete one revolution around the Sun. However, its rotation is much slower. One full rotation on its axis takes about 59 Earth days. This results in a unique phenomenon called a ‘resonant rotation,’ where Mercury rotates three times for every two orbits around the Sun. Due to this slow rotation, a single day-night cycle on Mercury (from one sunrise to the next) lasts 176 Earth days.</p>",

          surface:
            "<h2>Surface & Atmosphere</h2><p>Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and resembles that of the Moon. It has vast plains, high cliffs (known as scarps), and impact basins such as the massive Caloris Basin, which is about 1,550 km in diameter. The planet's surface has been shaped by asteroid impacts, volcanic activity, and the shrinking of its core, which has caused the surface to crack and form ridges. Since Mercury lacks a substantial atmosphere, it experiences extreme temperature fluctuations and does not have weather or wind erosion.</p>",

          temperature:
            "<h2>Temperature</h2><p>Temperatures on Mercury are among the most extreme in the Solar System. Since it has no significant atmosphere to trap heat, daytime temperatures can soar to 427°C (800°F), while nighttime temperatures drop as low as -173°C (-280°F). These variations make Mercury one of the most thermally extreme planets. Interestingly, despite its closeness to the Sun, some craters near Mercury’s poles remain permanently shadowed and contain water ice.</p>",

          exploration:
            "<h2>Exploration</h2><p>Mercury has been visited by only a few spacecraft due to the challenges of reaching and orbiting such a small, fast-moving planet close to the Sun. The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which flew by three times between 1974 and 1975, capturing the first close-up images of the planet. Later, NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft became the first to orbit Mercury in 2011, providing detailed data on its surface, composition, and magnetic field. The European-Japanese mission BepiColombo, launched in 2018, is currently en route to study Mercury in more detail.</p>",

          mythology:
            "<h2>Mythology</h2><p>Mercury is named after the Roman god of commerce, communication, and travelers. In mythology, Mercury (Hermes in Greek mythology) was the messenger of the gods, known for his speed and agility. The planet was given this name because of its fast movement across the sky, which ancient astronomers observed. Many ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Greeks, studied Mercury, associating it with different deities depending on their cultural beliefs.</p>",
